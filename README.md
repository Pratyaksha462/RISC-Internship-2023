<h1>Overview</h1>
During my research internship at IIIT DM Kancheepuram, under the guidance of Dr Rahul Raman, I had the opportunity to explore two fascinating fields of computer vision and machine learning.
The focus of my research report was the emerging field of explainable AI and how it can b used in animal biometrics.

<h1>Contributions</h1>
A significant part of my internship involved working on the development of a pedestrian model. 
I actively contributed to the creation of a comprehensive dataset and the annotation of videos for training the model. 
Working closely with the team, I fine-tuned the model to ensure accurate pedestrian detection and tracking.

<h1>Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration</h1>
One of the highlights of this internship was the chance to collaborate with experts in computer vision, biometrics, and AI ethics. 
These valuable interactions provided me with insights into the ethical considerations surrounding AI applications in animal biometrics. 
As it involved how AI models are needed to be understood and how one can understand them through different model of explainable AI

<h1>Research Skills</h1>
Throughout the internship, I had the opportunity to hone various research skills, including effective report writing and conducting thorough literature reviews. 
Research presentations significantly improved my communication skills and allowed me to share my findings with the team and the wider research community.

<h1>Exploring YOLO Models</h1>
In addition to my work on the pedestrian model, I also explored YOLO Models for object detection. 
This further expanded my knowledge and expertise in the exciting fields of computer vision and machine learning.

<h1>Commitment to Continuous Learning</h1>
Throughout the internship, I remained committed to continuous learning, constantly seeking to stay updated with the latest advancements in computer vision and machine learning. 
This dedication to learning has been instrumental in my growth as a researcher.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
My internship at IIIT DM Kancheepuram was an incredibly enriching experience. 
I was able to contribute to the development of a pedestrian model and gained valuable insights into the world of "Explainable AI" and "Animal Biometrics." 
Working with experts in various fields, honing research skills, and exploring cutting-edge technologies have left me deeply grateful for this valuable opportunity. 
What is the purpose of the pedestrian model developed during the internship? Did the author's research in explainable AI and animal biometrics lead to any specific findings or insights? Were there any challenges faced during the internship?I look forward to applying the knowledge and experience gained during this internship to future research endeavours.
